> module Hw6 (showAST) where


1. Build a Haskell module for the Abstract Syntax of Clite as an algebraic data type.

2. Write a showAST function in your module that displays a Clite Abstract Syntax tree using indentation for tree levels.

> showAST [] = []

3. Write a test program that displays the Abstract Syntax Tree for the clone.cpp program. You'll need to hard code the abstract syntax tree for the clone.cpp program, at least until you get a Haskell parser working for Clite!
